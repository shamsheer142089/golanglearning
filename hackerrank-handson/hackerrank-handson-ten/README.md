ckerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a GRADE  in the inclusive range from 0 to 100 .
Any  GRADE less than 40  is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's  GRADE according to these rules:

If the  difference between the  gradeand the next multiple of  5 is less than 3, round  up to the next multiple of 5 .
If the value of  is less than 38 , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
For example,grade=84  will be rounded to 85  but  grade=29 will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than 38.
