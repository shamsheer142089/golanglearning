Given the initial value of  grade for each of Sam's  students, write code to automate the rounding process.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sam's house has an apple tree and an orange tree that yield an abundance of fruit. In the diagram below, the red
region denotes his house, where is s the start point, and t is the endpoint. The apple tree is to the left of his
house, and the orange tree is to its right. You can assume the trees are located on a single point, where the
apple tree is at point a , and the orange tree is at point b.
When a fruit falls from its tree, it lands d units of distance from its tree of origin along the x-axis. A negative value
of means the fruit fell d units to the tree's left, and a positive value of means it falls d units to the tree's right.
Given the value d of for m apples and n oranges, determine how many apples and oranges will fall on Sam's
house (i.e., in the inclusive range )?
