**Map**

Map is a collcetion of key value pairs in go.

Map keys and values are statically typed.
One of the most useful data structures in computer science is the hash table.
 
Many hash table implementations exist with varying properties, but in general they offer fast lookups, adds, and deletes. 

Go provides a built-in map type that implements a hash table
